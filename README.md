 Expense Reimbursement Management System
 This project is intended to serve as a template/basis for an employee reimbursement ticket system. Employee Users are able to login, submit tickets, and view their own past tickets, whereas Finance Manager Users are able to view all tickets, filter and view tickets by status, and approve and deny tickets.
 
 This project was made using a Tomcat webserver, Eclipse IDE, and an AWS Relational Database. I would recommend utilizing either these tools or an equivalent set to make this project your own.
