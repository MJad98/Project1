# Expense Reimbursement Management System
 
## Project Description
This project is intended to serve as a template/basis for an employee reimbursement ticket system. Employee Users are able to login, submit tickets, and view their own past tickets, whereas Finance Manager Users are able to view all tickets, filter and view tickets by status, and approve and deny tickets. All ticket submissions and status updates are persisted in the database, and are retrieved or inserted as required by a Java-based backend server.
